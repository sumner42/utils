Long time developer in a proprietary Corporate environment.  Now starting
to become reaquainted with Fedora Linux at home. I miss the
collection of utilities I created, over the 26 years I was developing
on BSD/SysV/Solaris/CentOS at work.  So I've started recreating some of
them, and am evolving them to be as full-featured as the ones I created
back then.
